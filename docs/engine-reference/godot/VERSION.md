# Godot Engine — Version Reference

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Engine Version** | Godot 4.7.2 |
| **Installed at pin time** | 4.7.2 (stable, mono build) — probed 2026-10-07 at `C:/Users/arlob/Desktop/Godot_v4.7.2-stable_mono_win64/` |
| **Release Date** | NOT SOURCEABLE — 4.7 release date not retrieved this run (docs fetch failed) |
| **Project Pinned** | 2026-10-07 |

| **LLM Knowledge Cutoff** | May 2025 |

## Knowledge Gap Warning

The LLM's training data likely covers Godot up to ~4.3. Versions 4.4, 4.5,
and 4.6 introduced significant changes that the model does NOT know about.
Always cross-reference this directory before suggesting Godot API calls.

## Installed-Version Gap Warning

The warning above is one-directional — it covers the **model** knowing less than
this pin. The reverse gap is real and `/setup-engine` §3 creates it deliberately
("pin the newer one and upgrade later"): this reference can sit **ahead of the
installed editor**, and an agent citing it correctly then emits APIs that do not
compile locally. **Check `Installed at pin time` above before trusting a
version-qualified claim** — `NOT DETERMINED` means the gap is unknown, not absent.

## Post-Cutoff Version Timeline

| Version | Release | Risk Level | Key Theme |

| 4.6 | Jan 2026 | HIGH | Jolt default, glow rework, D3D12 default on Windows, IK restored |
| 4.7 | NOT SOURCEABLE | HIGH | NOT SOURCEABLE — 4.6→4.7 migration guide could not be fetched; run `/setup-engine refresh` |
